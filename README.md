# GLua-Countdown-Object
An entity that spawns a Cam2D3D to count down from XX minutes to 0.


Located in spawnmenu entities, Other tab

made by me.

Feel free to use it! This was my first beginner project

NEED HELP WITH: Starting the timer when entity is spawned rather than when the player joins the server.
